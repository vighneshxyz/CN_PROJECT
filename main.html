          <h2>Pure ALOHA Protocol ðŸ“¡</h2>
          <p>
            Pure ALOHA is a simple random access protocol used in computer networks. It is designed for shared communication channels where multiple stations can transmit data.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Pure ALOHA, a station can send a frame at any time. However, collisions may occur if two or more stations attempt to transmit simultaneously. Collisions are detected through feedback mechanisms, and retransmission is required if a collision occurs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The efficiency of Pure ALOHA is relatively low due to the likelihood of collisions. To address this, Slotted ALOHA was introduced, dividing time into slots to reduce the chances of collisions.
